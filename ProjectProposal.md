 ## Title: Game Logger

 ## Developers: Dillon Parker

 
# Project Overview:
 The problem that my project will address will be to organize peoples game collection and allow people to customize their collection. My project will not just include PC games but all the console systems such as GameCube, PlayStation, and Nintendo Entertainment System.  Some of the essential features of Game Logger would be to add games to different categories, a rating system, time played, and information about the game. The information will be collected form a game database api and will reach form background of the game to the genre of the game. The categories will be Completed, Playing, and Dropped.  A feature that I want would to be able to suggest games that would suit that person’s interest.  The reason I think that this idea could be good would be that it would provide people a way to store what games they have played and look at their collection for a game without having to go look at their physical collection and try to remember if they liked the game. A testable feature that I want would be to actually play the game using Steam and emulators to accomplish this goal. This feature would require a lot of work and figuring out each emulator works and how they launch the game.

# Similar Existing Works:
 The most similar application would be [LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com/) which does mostly everything that I just say but it will play the games. The only thing that it does not do is recommend other games. My project will be more of a simplification of [LaunchBox](https://www.launchbox-app.com/). The only thing that I could think that I could try to improve would be the UI and making it more user friendly.

# Previous Experience:
 The only real experiences I have that could help would be Computer Systems because of use using C as the language. Only experiences would be using the similar software’s and using that try and improve my product.

# Technology:
 The tools that I will be using will be Visual Studio 2017 and GitHub. I will create test using the built-in plugins of Visual Studio. Visual Studio will auto format the code.

# Risk Areas:
 The major concern that I have is that I have never used Visual Studio and created an application but I believe that I can create this kind of project. I will be watching and working with Visual Studio and asking my Father for advice about how to use it.
