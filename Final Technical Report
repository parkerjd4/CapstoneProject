## Abstract

This projectâ€™s main goal was to create an Windows application to log peoples game collection. There are four main task that are needed to achieve this goal. The first task would be having a GUI to hold a list of games that the user will add. The GUI will have a listview to hold all the names of the games that the user will add. The second task would be to have buttons for the users to add and remove games form the listview and the xml file that holds the information. The menus for adding and removing games will appear in another window. When adding games, the user will have to enter the name of the game and select a status form the combo box. The remove games will just require the name of the game. The third task would be having a xml file that holds tags like name of game, release date, developers, publishers, platforms, genres, status, description, and images. The xml file will help with displaying the information of the game that the user clicks on within the listview. The fourth task would be able to recommend games based on the game that you are viewing. A window will pop up with a TableLayoutPanel that holds four games. The one task that was out of this projects scope was being able to accomplish would to be able to play the game using my application. All the main tasks were completed, but the visuals of the project are not great.  The methods that was used to complete this project was Visual Studio 2017 for development, the language was C#, and the database was Giant Bomb.
