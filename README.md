Gamelogger is an application that allows users to add their gaming collection to this application. Gamelogger will allow users to add/remove games form its listview. The user can also click on a cell in the listview that contains a game and it will pop up a window that has information on that game. This window will also have a button that allows the users to look at similar games.
